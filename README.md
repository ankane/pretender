# Pretender

As an admin, there are times you want to see exactly what another user sees. Meet Pretender.

- Easily switch between users
- Minimal code changes
- Plays nicely with Action Cable and auditing tools

:boom: [Rock on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBjQ9tuuTJQ)

Pretender is flexible and lightweight - less than 100 lines of code :-)

Works with any authentication system - [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), [Authlogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic), and [Sorcery](https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery) to name a few.

:tangerine: Battle-tested at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/opensource)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/pretender/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ankane/pretender/actions)

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "pretender"
```

And add this to your `ApplicationController`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  impersonates :user
end
```

## How It Works

Sign in as another user with:

```
impersonate_user(user)
```

The `current_user` method now returns the impersonated user.

You can access the true user with:

```
true_user
```

And stop impersonating with:

```ruby
stop_impersonating_user
```

### Sample Implementation

Create a controller

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_admin! # your authorization method

  def index
    @users = User.order(:id)
  end

  def impersonate
    user = User.find(params[:id])
    impersonate_user(user)
    redirect_to root_path
  end

  def stop_impersonating
    stop_impersonating_user
    redirect_to root_path
  end
end
```

Add routes

```ruby
resources :users, only: [:index] do
  post :impersonate, on: :member
  post :stop_impersonating, on: :collection
end
```

Create an index view

```erb
<ul>
  <% @users.each do |user| %>
    <li>Sign in as <%= link_to user.name, impersonate_user_path(user), method: :post %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

And show when someone is signed in as another user in your application layout

```erb
<% if impersonating_user? %>
  You (<%= true_user.name %>) are signed in as <%= current_user.name %>
  <%= link_to "Back to admin", stop_impersonating_users_path, method: :post %>
<% end %>
```

## Audits

If you keep audit logs with a library like [Audited](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited), make sure it uses the **true user**.

```ruby
Audited.current_user_method = :true_user
```

## Action Cable

And add this to your `ApplicationCable::Connection`:

```ruby
module ApplicationCable
  class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
    identified_by :current_user, :true_user
    impersonates :user

    def connect
      self.current_user = find_verified_user
      reject_unauthorized_connection unless current_user
    end

    private

    def find_verified_user
      env["warden"].user # for Devise
    end
  end
end
```

The `current_user` method now returns the impersonated user in channels.

## Configuration

Pretender is super flexible. You can change the names of methods and even impersonate multiple roles at the same time. Here’s the default configuration.

```ruby
impersonates :user,
             method: :current_user,
             with: ->(id) { User.find_by(id: id) }
```

Mold it to fit your application.

```ruby
impersonates :account,
             method: :authenticated_account,
             with: ->(id) { EnterpriseAccount.find_by(id: id) }
```

This creates three methods:

```ruby
true_account
impersonate_account
stop_impersonating_account
```
